Outage Postmortem: Web Stack Service Degradation

Issue Summary:

Duration: August 8, 2023, 10:00 AM - August 8, 2023, 2:30 PM (UTC)

Impact: A degradation in the performance of our main web application service led to slow response times and intermittent outages. Approximately 30% of users experienced delays and errors during this period.

Root Cause:

The root cause of the service degradation was traced back to an unexpected surge in incoming traffic combined with a misconfigured caching mechanism. As the traffic increased, the cache hit rate decreased, causing the service to rely heavily on backend requests, leading to performance bottlenecks.

Timeline:

10:00 AM: Issue detected through a monitoring alert indicating a spike in response times.
10:15 AM: Engineering team alerted, began investigating the issue.
10:30 AM: Initial assumption made that the database was the bottleneck due to high read queries.
11:00 AM: Database team initiated query optimizations to alleviate potential load issues.
12:00 PM: Investigation shifted to load balancer settings, suspecting uneven distribution.
12:30 PM: Realized the cache hit rate dropped significantly as traffic increased.
1:00 PM: Escalated the issue to DevOps team for further analysis and resolution.
2:00 PM: Identified misconfigured cache eviction policy contributing to the problem.
2:30 PM: Cache settings adjusted and service performance gradually improved.
Root Cause and Resolution:

The primary cause of the service degradation was the misconfigured cache eviction policy, which led to cache purging at a high rate even for frequently accessed resources. This resulted in excessive backend requests and slower response times.

To resolve the issue, the DevOps team adjusted the cache eviction policy to be more adaptive to traffic fluctuations. This allowed the cache to be more selective about purging and ensured that frequently accessed resources remained cached during high traffic periods. After the cache adjustments were deployed, the service response times returned to normal levels.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

To Improve/Fix:

Optimize Caching Strategy: Review and fine-tune the caching mechanism to better handle traffic spikes and variations.
Enhance Monitoring: Implement enhanced monitoring for cache hit rate and service response times to detect anomalies more effectively.
Load Testing: Conduct thorough load testing to simulate heavy traffic scenarios and identify potential performance bottlenecks.
Tasks to Address the Issue:

Review Cache Configuration: Audit and adjust cache eviction policies to ensure they align with traffic patterns.
Implement Traffic Throttling: Introduce traffic throttling mechanisms to prevent sudden influxes of requests from overwhelming the service.
Update Monitoring Alerts: Set up alerts for cache hit rate thresholds and unusual traffic patterns.
Documentation Update: Document the incident, root cause, and resolution in the internal knowledge base for future reference.
In conclusion, the service degradation was swiftly addressed by identifying and rectifying the misconfigured caching mechanism. The incident highlighted the importance of thorough monitoring, adaptive caching strategies, and the necessity of load testing to ensure a resilient web stack. The proposed measures will help safeguard against similar issues in the future, contributing to improved user experiences and service stability.
